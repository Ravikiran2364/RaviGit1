Agents:

Yes, Harness CI/CD contains agents. Agents are an important part of the Harness CI/CD platform, as they are responsible for 
executing the deployment workflows and pipelines that are defined in the Harness platform.

Agents are lightweight software components that are installed on the target deployment environment, such as servers or 
virtual machines. These agents are used to facilitate the deployment process by executing the necessary commands and scripts to deploy the application or infrastructure changes.

Harness agents communicate with the Harness platform to receive instructions and report back on the progress of deployments. 
This communication is secured using TLS encryption and can be configured to use different authentication mechanisms, such as tokens or SSH keys.
